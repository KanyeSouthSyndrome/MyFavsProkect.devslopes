🏋️ Exercise: Adding CSS to "MyFavs" project


📣 Getting Started
Your goal is to make this look "presentable". Don't add random colors and sizes to things. Find colors that complement each other. Size your elements so they're not awkwardly big or small. As a web developer, it's important to create UI that is appealing to the user. You don't have to become an expert designer by any means - but it's a good practice to "care" about the look of the projects you build.


🛠 Requirements
Add a border of your choice to all table, th, tr, td elements.
Add a 10px padding to the right and left of every <td> element using the padding shorthand method.
Add a max width to all images so all the table cells display more evenly.
Make all the table cells an even width.
Make all the text in your ordered lists in the "Fav" column red
Make all the text in your ordered lists in the "Not Fav" column blue.
Add a font color and background color of your choice to the table headers.
Add rounded corners to all your images
